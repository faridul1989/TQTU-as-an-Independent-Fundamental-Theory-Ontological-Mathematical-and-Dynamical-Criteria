\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Tanfarid Quantum--Thermodynamic Universe (TQTU) is proposed as an independent
fundamental theory of physical reality. It is neither a modification nor a
reinterpretation of general relativity or quantum field theory, but originates
from a distinct foundational postulate: a non-equilibrium, entropy-regulated,
spin-coherent plasma constitutes the primary substrate of nature. From this
substrate, spacetime geometry, quantum behavior, and matter emerge as collective,
coarse-grained descriptions. This article defines objective criteria for
theoretical independence in fundamental physics and demonstrates that TQTU
satisfies them at the ontological, mathematical, and dynamical levels.
\end{abstract}

\section{Criteria for Theoretical Independence}

A physical theory qualifies as independent if it satisfies four conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Ontological Primacy}: It originates from its own foundational
postulates rather than being derived from an existing theory.
\item \textbf{Mathematical Autonomy}: It possesses a self-contained mathematical
structure defining its degrees of freedom and dynamics.
\item \textbf{Asymmetric Recovery}: Established theories arise as limits without
serving as axioms.
\item \textbf{Conceptual Novelty}: Its core physical concepts are primitive
within the theory itself.
\end{enumerate}

Historically, Newtonian mechanics, general relativity, and quantum mechanics each
satisfied these criteria upon introduction. Independence is therefore a matter
of foundational origin, not of stylistic difference.

\section{Ontological Independence of TQTU}

TQTU begins from a distinct axiom:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Physical reality is fundamentally a coherent, non-equilibrium plasma
regulated by entropy flow and global spin coherence.}
\end{quote}

Spacetime geometry, gravitation, and quantum phenomena are not primary entities
but emergent descriptions arising from the collective dynamics of this substrate.
This ontology differs fundamentally from both geometric-first and field-first
frameworks.

\section{Independence from General Relativity}

General relativity assumes spacetime geometry as fundamental and gravity as its
curvature. TQTU inverts this hierarchy. Geometry arises as a macroscopic,
near-equilibrium description of plasma--entropy dynamics. Einstein-like field
equations appear only in regimes of weak entropy gradients and approximate
homogeneity. Thus, general relativity is recovered as a limiting description,
establishing an asymmetric and therefore independent relationship.

\section{Independence from Quantum Field Theory}

Quantum field theory assumes quantized fields defined on a spacetime background.
TQTU instead posits a coherent plasma--spin continuum governed by thermodynamic
principles. Quantum behavior emerges from collective coherence and statistical
organization of the substrate. Although a path-integral formulation can be
written for TQTU, quantization is not axiomatic but derivative.

\section{Mathematical and Dynamical Autonomy}

TQTU is governed by its own dynamical variables: plasma density, spin coherence,
and entropy flow. Its governing principle is the extremization of entropy
production subject to coherence constraints. Standard actions such as the
Einstein--Hilbert or Standard Model Lagrangians appear only as effective
descriptions in restricted limits, confirming unification rather than
dependence.

\section{Emergent Constants: Gamma and Phi}

Characteristic dimensionless numbers arise dynamically:

\begin{itemize}
\item The entropy attractor $\gamma \approx 1.060$ emerges as a preferred scaling
exponent in non-equilibrium renormalization.
\item The golden ratio $\varphi$ appears as the symmetric fixed point of the
scaling map $r \rightarrow \gamma + 1/r$ when $\gamma = 1$.
\end{itemize}

Neither quantity is postulated; both are outputs of the theory's internal
dynamics.

\section{Distinction from Reformulations}

TQTU is not an entropic reinterpretation of gravity, not a plasma-based dark
matter substitute, and not a numerological framework. It represents a shift in
the foundational starting point of physics itself.

\section{Conclusion}

The Tanfarid Quantum--Thermodynamic Universe qualifies as an independent
fundamental theory by satisfying established criteria of ontological primacy,
mathematical autonomy, asymmetric recovery, and conceptual novelty. It engages
existing theories deeply but is not constructed from them. TQTU provides a
coherent foundation capable of supporting a complete physical worldview and
generating testable predictions.
