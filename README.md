\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Tanfarid Quantum--Thermodynamic Universe (TQTU) is proposed as an independent fundamental theory of physical reality. It is not a modification or reinterpretation of general relativity or quantum field theory, but arises from a distinct foundational postulate: a non-equilibrium, entropy-regulated, spin-coherent plasma constitutes the primary substrate of nature. From this substrate, spacetime geometry, quantum behaviour, and matter emerge as collective, coarse-grained descriptions. This article formulates objective criteria for theoretical independence in fundamental physics and argues that TQTU satisfies them at the ontological, mathematical, and dynamical levels.
\end{abstract}

\section{Criteria for Theoretical Independence}

A physical theory qualifies as independent if it satisfies four conditions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Ontological primacy}: It originates from its own foundational postulates rather than being derived from an existing theory.
  \item \textbf{Mathematical autonomy}: It possesses a self-contained mathematical structure defining its degrees of freedom and dynamics.
  \item \textbf{Asymmetric recovery}: Established theories arise as limiting cases without serving as axioms.
  \item \textbf{Conceptual novelty}: Its core physical concepts are primitive within the theory itself.
\end{enumerate}

Historically, Newtonian mechanics, general relativity, and quantum mechanics each satisfied these criteria at their introduction. Independence is therefore a question of foundational origin, not of stylistic or notational difference.

\section{Ontological Independence of TQTU}

TQTU begins from a distinct axiom:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Physical reality is fundamentally a coherent, non-equilibrium plasma regulated by entropy flow and global spin coherence.}
\end{quote}

Spacetime geometry, gravitation, and quantum phenomena are not primary entities but emergent descriptions arising from the collective dynamics of this substrate. This ontology differs fundamentally from both geometry-first and field-first frameworks.

\section{Independence from General Relativity}

General relativity treats spacetime geometry as fundamental and gravity as its curvature. TQTU inverts this hierarchy: geometry appears as a macroscopic, near-equilibrium description of plasma--entropy dynamics. Einstein-like field equations arise only in regimes of weak entropy gradients and approximate homogeneity. General relativity is thus recovered as a limiting description, establishing an asymmetric and therefore independent relationship.

\section{Independence from Quantum Field Theory}

Quantum field theory assumes quantized fields defined on a spacetime background. TQTU instead posits a coherent plasma--spin continuum governed by thermodynamic principles. Quantum behaviour emerges from collective coherence and statistical organisation of the substrate. Although a path-integral formulation can be written for TQTU, quantisation is derivative rather than axiomatic.

\section{Mathematical and Dynamical Autonomy}

TQTU is governed by its own dynamical variables: plasma density, spin coherence, and entropy flow. Its governing principle is the extremisation of entropy production subject to coherence constraints. Standard actions such as the Einstein--Hilbert or Standard Model Lagrangians arise only as effective descriptions in restricted regimes, indicating unification without dependence.

\section{Emergent Constants: \texorpdfstring{$\gamma$}{gamma} and \texorpdfstring{$\phi$}{phi}}

Characteristic dimensionless numbers arise dynamically:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The entropy attractor $\gamma \approx 1.060$ appears as a preferred scaling exponent in non-equilibrium renormalisation flows.
  \item The golden ratio $\phi$ appears as the symmetric fixed point of the scaling map $r \mapsto \gamma + 1/r$ in the special case $\gamma = 1$.
\end{itemize}

Neither quantity is postulated; both are outputs of the theory's internal dynamics.

\section{Distinction from Reformulations}

TQTU is not an entropic reinterpretation of gravity, a plasma-based dark matter surrogate, or a numerological framework. It represents a change in the foundational starting point of physics itself.

\section{Conclusion}

The Tanfarid Quantum--Thermodynamic Universe satisfies established criteria of ontological primacy, mathematical autonomy, asymmetric recovery, and conceptual novelty, and therefore qualifies as an independent fundamental theory. It engages existing frameworks deeply but is not constructed from them. TQTU provides a coherent foundation capable of supporting a complete physical worldview and generating testable predictions.
